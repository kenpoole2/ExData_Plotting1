## Introduction

This assignment uses data from
the <a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/">UC Irvine Machine
Learning Repository</a>, a popular repository for machine learning
datasets. In particular, we will be using the "Individual household
electric power consumption Data Set" which I have made available on
the course web site:



Download the dataset from the link below to your computer. Unzip the
downloaded file into your working directory. Make sure it is named 
<b>household_power_consumption.txt</b>

The functions listed below require the SQLDF package to be installed or your computer connected to the
internet so that the package can be downloaded.

<ol>
<li><b>plot1.R</b> will import the unzipped file that is in your working directory and generate the plot1.png file</li>
<li><b>plot2.R</b> will import the unzipped file that is in your working directory and generate the plot2.png file</li>
<li><b>plot3.R</b> will import the unzipped file that is in your working directory and generate the plot3.png file</li>
<li><b>plot4.R</b> will import the unzipped file that is in your working directory and generate the plot4.png file</li>
</ol>
